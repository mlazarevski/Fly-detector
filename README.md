First there is interface from there one should mark the videos (arenas in each video).
Secondly choose track, then count. General idea is that the flies shoul first be detected, then further proces the information about detections. 
This file will be extended. 

When reviewing the code follow the steps User interface, Full Code without Threads, Kalman.
